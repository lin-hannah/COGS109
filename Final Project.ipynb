    "Our team decided to conduct an analysis using the Course and Professor Evaluation (CAPEs) system at UCSD to understand what factors (time commitment, average grade received, levels of difficulty, relevancy of materials, etc) would affect the ratings of course and instructor recommendation the most. We believe that this is an important topic to study because CAPEs is universally used by all students at UCSD to decide what classes and professors to take, thus exploring the relationship between different factors and understanding which would hold the highest coefficient would not only benefit students but also instructors and administration to improve their performance.
